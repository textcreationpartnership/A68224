            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>
                     <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>Pon the ninth day of <hi>Septemb.</hi> la≈øt pa≈øt, there was a Yeoman of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øt reputation, dwelling in the Towne of <hi>Dichet,</hi> which is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in three myles of <hi>Bruton</hi> (the mo≈øt ancient towne within <hi>Sommer≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhire</hi>) who≈øe name is <hi>Steuen Coo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per,</hi> a man of good wealth, and well beloued of his neighbours: who beeing ≈øicke, and lying in a weake ≈øtate, ≈øent his wife (who≈øe name was <hi>Margaret Cooper</hi>) vpon the ninth day of <hi>Sept.</hi> pa≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Gloce≈øter-≈øhire,</hi> to take order concerning a Farme which he hath in a village called <hi>Rockhampton, alias Roc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kington,</hi> at who≈øe comming thither, it ≈ø√©emed al things were not according to her minde. Thus continuing there one day and ≈øomething more, ≈øhee returned home to her hu≈øband, partly agrieued at ≈øuch things as ≈øhee thought her hu≈øband might reforme, if God lent him life. Now when ≈øh√©e was come home againe to <hi>Dichet,</hi> ≈øhe found her hu≈øband recouered to an indifferent health: to whom ≈øhee beganne to v≈øe very much idle talke, as well concerning the ≈øame Farme, as al≈øo concerning an olde groate which her ≈øonne (being a little boy) had found
<pb facs="tcp:20541:4"/>
about one weeke before. Thus ≈øhee continued (as it were one that had beene bewitched or haunted with an euill Spirit) vntill Tue≈øday at night following, which night ≈øhe tooke her re≈øt ≈øomething indifferently vntill towards the morning: at which time ≈øhee began with much vaine ≈øpeech to di≈øquiet her hu≈øband, and to v≈øe much idle talke: but her hu≈øband ≈øeeing her in ≈øuch a minde, and finding that ≈øhee was as it were one that were de≈øperate, hee per≈øwadod her to call vpon God, and that b√©eing the creature of God, ≈øhee ≈øhould not forget to call vpon her Creatour in the day of trouble, wherefore he coun≈øelled her to pray with him, and to ≈øay the Lords Prayer after him, which ≈øhe partly did. But the Diuell, who alway doth build his Chappell ≈øo neere as hee may to vexe Gods Church, began to withdrawe her from Prayer, and to put her in minde to call in mo≈øt fearefull ≈øort for the groat which her ≈øonne had lately found, as al≈øo for her Wedding Ring, de≈øiring to ≈øee them with all ≈øpeede: her hu≈øband made no great ha≈øt thereunto, but continued in Prayer, that it would plea≈øe GOD, to ≈øend her a more quiet ≈øpirit and to ≈øtrengthen her, that faith might ≈øpeedily vanqui≈øh ≈øuch vanity in her. But the more hee prayed and per≈øwaded her to Prayer, the more ≈øhee ≈øeemed to bee as it were troubled with ≈øome euill ≈øpirit, calling ≈øtill for the olde groat, which her hu≈øband neglected to ≈øhew her: whereat ≈øhe began with a very ≈øterne and ≈øtaring countenance to looke on her hu≈øband in mo≈øt wonderfull ≈øort, ≈øo that h√©e was ≈øore frighted with the ≈øame. Then he called for her ≈øi≈øter, for that he was not able to keepe her in her bed: which when her ≈øi≈øter and other were come into the Chamber, they kept her downe violently in the bed: and foorthwith ≈øhee was ≈øo ≈øore tormented, that ≈øhee fomed at the mouth, and was ≈øhaken with ≈øuch force, that the bed and the Chamber did ≈øhake and moue in mo≈øt ≈øtrange
<pb facs="tcp:20541:4"/>
≈øort: her hu≈øband continued praying for her deliuerance: ≈øo that within one halfe houre after her ≈øhaking was left, ≈øhee began to tell them that ≈øhe had been in the Towne to beate away the Beare which followed her into the yard when ≈øhee came out of the Countrie, which to her thinking had no head. Then her hu≈øband and friendes wi≈øhed her to leaue tho≈øe vaine imaginations, per≈øwaded her that it was nothing but the lightnes of her braine, which was become idle for want of re≈øt. Wherefore her hu≈øband and friends exhorted her to ≈øay the Lords prayer with them, which ≈øhe did, and after tooke ≈ømall re≈øt. And thus ≈øhe remained vntill the Sunday following: in which time ≈øhe continued raging as it were be≈øtraught of her memory, which came by fits, to the great griefe of her hu≈øband, friends, and neighbours. Vpon the Sater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day following there was good hope of her recouerie, for that ≈øhee in the night before had taken ≈øome rea≈øonable re≈øt: her friends and neighbours came to comfort her, yet ≈øometime ≈øhee would talke ≈øomewhat idly to them, which came by ≈ømall fittes. And vpon the Sunday ≈øhee ≈øeemed very patient and conformable to rea≈øon, vntill midnight: at which time the Candle, which was ≈øet burning in the ≈øame Chamber, was burned out. She then ≈øuddenly waking, called to her hu≈øband, and cried out, ≈øaying that ≈øhe did ≈øee a ≈øtrange thing like vnto a Snaile, carrying fire in mo≈øt wonderfull ≈øort. Whereat her hu≈øband was amazed: and ≈ø√©eing the Candle was cleane burnt out, called to his brother and ≈øi≈øter that were in the hou≈øe with other of their friends watching and ≈øit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting vp, to comfort her if her extreame fit ≈øhould any way mole≈øt her, who hearing her hu≈øband call, came in and brought a Candle lighted, and ≈øet it on the Table which ≈øtood neere where the woman lay. She began then to waxe as one very fearefull, ≈øaying to her hu≈øband and the re≈øt: doe not you ≈øee the Diuell? Whereat they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired
<pb facs="tcp:20541:5"/>
her to remember GOD, and to call for grace, that her faith might bee onely fixed vpon him to the van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øhing of the Diuell, and his a≈ø≈øaults. Well (quoth ≈øhe) if you ≈øee nothing now, you ≈øhall ≈øee ≈øomething by and by: and forthwith they heard a noi≈øe in the ≈øtreet, as it had been the comming of two or three Carts, and pre≈øently they in the chamber cryed out ≈øaying, Lord helpe vs, what manner of thing is this that commeth heere? Then her hu≈øband looking vp in his bed, e≈øpied a thing come to the bed much like vnto a Beare, but it had no head nor tayle, halfe a yard in length, and halfe a yard in height: her hu≈øband ≈øeeing it come to the bed ro≈øe vp, and tooke a ioyned ≈øtoole and ≈øtroke at the ≈øaid thing, the ≈øtroke ≈øounded as though he had ≈øtroken vpon a Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therbed: then it came to the woman and ≈øtroke her thr√©e times vpon the feete, and tooke her out of the bed and ≈øo rouled her too and fro in the chamber, and vnder the bed. The people there pre≈øent, to the number of ≈øeuen per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons, were ≈øo greatly amazed with this horrible ≈øight that they knew not what to doe, yet they called ≈øtill vpon GOD for his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance: but the Candle was ≈øo dimme, that they could ≈øcar≈øely ≈øee one another. At the la≈øt this Mon≈øter, which we ≈øuppo≈øe to be the Diuell, did thru≈øt the womans head betwixt her legges, and ≈øo rouled her in a round compa≈ø≈øe like an hoope through three other Chambers downe an high paire of ≈øtaires in the Hall where hee kept her the ≈øpace of a quarter of an houre. Her hu≈øband, and they in the Chamber aboue dur≈øt not come downe to her, but remained in prayer weeping at the ≈øtaires head, gr√©euou≈øly lamenting to ≈øee her ≈øo carried away. There was ≈øuch an horrible ≈øtinke in the Hall, and ≈øuch fierie flames, that they were glad to ≈øtoppe their no≈øes with cloathes and nap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins. Then the woman cryed out, calling to her hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band. Now he is gone. Then (quoth hee) in the name
<pb facs="tcp:20541:5"/>
of GOD come vp to mee. And ≈øo euen vpon the ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daine ≈øhe was come ≈øo quickly that they greatly maruai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led at it. Then they brought her to bed, and foure of them kept downe the cloathes about the bed, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in prayer for her. The Candle in the Chamber could not burne cleere, but was very dimme, and ≈øud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly the woman was got out of the bed, and the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowe at the beds head opened: whether the woman did vnpin the window or how it came to pa≈ø≈øe they knewe not, but it was opened, and the womans legges after a maruellous manner thru≈øt out at the window, ≈øo that they were cla≈øped about the po≈øte in the middle of the windowe, betweene her legges. The people in the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber heard a thing knocke at her feete as it had beene vpon a Tubbe, and they ≈øaw a great fire, as it ≈øeemed to them, at her feete, the ≈øtinke whereof was horrible. The ≈øorrowfull hu≈øband and his Brother imboldens them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelues in the Lord, and did charge the Diuell in the name of the Father, the Sonne, and the Holy Gho≈øt, to depart from her, and to trouble her no more. Then they laide hands on her, and cryed to the Lord to helpe them in that their great neede, and ≈øo puld her in againe, and ≈øet her vpon her feet. Then ≈øhe looked out at a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow, and began to ≈øay, O Lord (quoth ≈øhe) me thinke I ≈øee a little Childe: but they gaue no regard to her. The≈øe words ≈øhe ≈øpake two or three times. So at the la≈øt they all looked out at the window: and loe they e≈øpied a thing like vnto a little Childe, with a very bright ≈øhining countenance, ca≈øting a great light in the Chamber, and then the Candle burned verie brightly, ≈øo that they might one ≈øee another. Then fell they flat to the ground, and prai≈øed the LORD that hee had ≈øo wonderfully a≈ø≈øi≈øted them, and ≈øo the Childe vani≈øhed away. Then the woman being in ≈øome
<pb facs="tcp:20541:6"/>
better feeling of her ≈øelfe, was laide in her bed, and ≈øhee a≈øked forgiuene≈ø≈øe at Gods hands, and of all that ≈øhee had offended, acknowledging that it was for her ≈øinnes that ≈øhee was ≈øo tormented of the euill Spirit. And ≈øo God bee thanked ≈øhee hath euer ≈øince been in ≈øome rea≈øonable order, for there hath b√©en with her many godly learned men from diuers places of the Countrey.</p>

                     <seg rend="decorInit">V</seg>PON the fir≈øt of <hi>October</hi> la≈øt pa≈øt, 1613. There was a marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age ≈øolemnized at <hi>Ro≈øtorfe,</hi> a mile di≈øtant from <hi>Melwing,</hi> in <hi>Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,</hi> betweene one <hi>Iames Crani≈øen,</hi> an hone≈øt Townes man: and one <hi>Margaret Hen≈ølers,</hi> the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Hans Steeman</hi> of <hi>Melwing,</hi> decea≈øed. This <hi>Iames</hi> had beene ≈øeruant and Clarke, vnto the wor≈øhipfull mai≈øter <hi>George Ramyts</hi> Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, the time of twelue yeeres, who was (by his Mai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øter and ≈øundry other per≈øons of good calling,) brought to the Church, and at their returne were conducted to his Mai≈øters hou≈øe againe, who had prepared for him and his gue≈øts, a ≈øufficient Fea≈øt, at his owne co≈øts and charges: and although this <hi>Iames</hi> was but a ha≈øband mans Sonne, yet was hee beloued of the whole inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, and that of the chiefe≈øt ≈øort. Thus was this Fea≈øt kept in good order, with great Loue and quietne≈ø≈øe: mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb facs="tcp:20541:8"/>
with their meate, hone≈øt mirth, well liked, and noted of ≈øundry Nobles and Gentlemen, beeing pre≈øent at the ≈øame Fea≈øt, and inhabiting there abouts.</p>
                  <p>The next day following, a young maide of the age of fouret√©ene yeares, beeing Si≈øter to the Bridegroome, came to the wedding-hou≈øe to her Brother, bringing with her the Daughter of one <hi>Simon Franiken</hi> of <hi>Melwing:</hi> both which after they had ≈øeene the hou≈øe, and in what or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der things ≈øtood, were de≈øirous to ≈øee the Daughter of the Wor≈øhipfull Mai≈øter <hi>George van Ramyttes,</hi> who≈øe name was Mi≈øtris <hi>Annys:</hi> who beeing in the Chamber, they both went to vi≈øite her, and doing their duties, they demanded how ≈øhe did: ≈øhe aun≈øwered, indifferent well. Then the two Maides ≈øate downe by her, where toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they conferred of many matters, e≈øpecially, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning their attire and apparell. The Bridegroome, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øpecified, had made his Si≈øter a ≈øilk vpper-body, with which ≈øhee had dre≈ø≈øed her ≈øelfe as hand≈øomely as ≈øhee might, and withall ≈øhe wore the be≈øt and ≈øeemlie≈øt appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rell that ≈øhe had put on for that day. But the Gentlewo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ≈øeeing it, beganne to floute at her, ≈øaying: Can thy Father cloath thee thus, and ≈øeeme ≈øo poore? Alas Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtre≈ø≈øe (quoth the Maiden) hitherto my poore Father hath alwaies to his power apparelled me: but this which you ≈øee, my Brother hath be≈øtowed on mee, to doe him hone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty at his mariage: God knoweth who ≈øhall weare it out, how long I ≈øhall owe it, or when I ≈øhall put it on again. And though wee bee poore in goods, I tru≈øt God will make vs rich in Spirit, and ≈øo ≈øhee helde her peace, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting for a fine Cake and Wine, wherewith they made merry. Soone after, the Citizens Daughter that was well apparelled (and ≈øomewhat vaine-glorious withall) ≈øaid that her mother gaue her all things ≈øhee could get,, but her Father was ≈øo hard, that ≈øhee might not weare that ≈øhe had, but was faine to k√©ep it from his
<pb facs="tcp:20541:8"/>
≈øight. The Gentlewoman replyed, ≈øaying: my Father biddeth me weare what I will, and if it were not for of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence vnto the Nobilitie, hee would apparell mee like a Princes: and therewithall ≈øhee cau≈øed ≈øundry faire Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wels and Chaines to be taken foorth of her Che≈øts, which were very curiou≈øly wrought, and cau≈øed great admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration vnto the beholders. The poore Countrey Maide that knew no Pride, nor had any ≈øuch attire to boa≈øt on, held her peace, accounted her ≈øelfe with her pouertie, as acceptable before God, as the riche≈øt or fayre≈øt of tho≈øe fine Dames pre≈øent: ≈øaying inwardly to her ≈øelfe, God is a iealous God, he hateth Pride, he puni≈øheth the vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteous, he comforteth the poore, which haue no delight therein: and maintaineth them that are continually bent to the ≈øeruice of him.</p>
                  <p>After that al together had talked their plea≈øures, to their contentment: euery one ≈øeuerally tooke their leaue one of another, and after a while departed to the hou≈øes of their Parents.</p>
                  <p>The third day after this Marriage was ≈øolemnized, all the ioy was turned into heauine≈ø≈øe, for the death of two of the Maidens before mentioned: namely, the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to the Gentleman, and the Si≈øter of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groome, who died both in one afternoone, betweene thr√©e and foure of the clocke. This ≈øo ≈øodaine death, brought great terrour and feare vnto their Parents, and al≈øo to the hearers thereof, in≈øomuch that ≈øome thought them to be poy≈øoned, and other gaue foorth their iudgements ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their fanta≈øies.</p>
                  <p>The next day after, preparation was made for their buriall: <hi>Nicholas Faber,</hi> Par≈øon of that Villedge, would haue had them both buried in one graue, but the Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man would not. Great lamentation was made for both the≈øe Maidens, the Gentleman and his friends, for the lo≈ø≈øe of his Daughter: and the Father and Mother, with
<pb facs="tcp:20541:9"/>
her Brother and Friends, for the lo≈ø≈øe of their god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Childe. Now the Mother of this poore Maide, vnder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding that her neighbours were in hand to winde her vp, and ≈øo to ≈øend her to the earth: came vnto them and de≈øired that ≈øhee might yet once more ≈øee her Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which they willingly granted: ≈øo they went alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to the dead Corpes, (which had been laid foorth, the full ≈øpace of two and twenty houres) and the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lifted vp the ≈øheete, ≈øighing, purpo≈øing then to take her la≈øt farewell, and fight of her deare Daughter, whom ≈øhee ≈øo tenderly loued. But contrarie to her expectati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of all the beholders, her Daughter, euen as one awaked from a ≈ølumber, rai≈øed vp her≈øelfe, and with a milde and cheerefull countenance, ≈øpake vnto her Mother as followeth. My mo≈øt deere Mother, why haue you ≈øinned ≈øo ≈øore again≈øt GOD? You haue made me ≈øorrowfull many times, but bee you content, GOD hath forgiuen all, for I am ≈øent as a me≈ø≈øenger to you, and within fiue daies I ≈øhall returne againe to the place I came from, where I ≈øhall liue in all peace. Therewith they fetcht her cloathes, which ≈øhee put on, and walking with them, ≈øhe demanded meate.</p>
                  <p>This ≈øodaine ≈øight amazed the beholders, for they looked for ≈øome other meaning in it. But where as this Maide was ≈øeldome before ≈øeene to be merry, They now perceiued her more cheerefull, and with a plea≈øant di≈øpo≈øed countenance, ≈øo that the apparant ≈øhow of her ie≈øture was wonderfull to beholde, then meate was brought, and ≈øhe did eate in all mens ≈øight, di≈øge≈øting it naturally.</p>
                  <p>Diuers of the cheefe of the Towne came to ≈øee this ≈øtrange euent, where after many ≈øpeeches by them vttered the Maide required ≈øilence, and to them all ≈øhe ≈øaid.</p>
                  <p>Beloued Chri≈øtians, wonder not that I haue b√©en a
<pb facs="tcp:20541:9"/>
≈øhort time from you: but be thankfull to God, that he hath certified you by ≈øundry ≈øignes, how the ende of the world is at hand, and the day of re≈øt comming to reioyce vs: Our charge ≈øhall be taken away, and our trauaile haue an ende: Let vs make our ≈øelues ready again≈øt the Sabaoth of our Sauiour, the onely true Sonne of God. Let vs now with pure hearts, prepare to meete the heauenly Bridegroome, that with him wee may enter into his euerla≈øting Kingdome, where we ≈øhall enioy e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternall life.</p>
                  <p>Mai≈øter <hi>Nicholas Faber,</hi> (Par≈øon of the Towne) de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded of her where ≈øhe had beene? To whom ≈øhe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwered: I was ouertaken n√©ere the bridge of the Brooke, by a comely olde man, with a long gray Beard, who ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted m√©e, ≈øaying: Daughter, whether wilt thou? Is thy Father at home? I an≈øwered yea. Then ≈øaid he to mee, come my louing Daughter, I mu≈øt needes talke with thee, and tell thee that which as yet is hidden from th√©e, for great effect dependeth thereupon. And be not afrayde, let the grace of God ≈øuffice th√©e, and looke that you conceale not my words, but reueale them to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers: tell what I ≈øhew you, vnto olde and young.</p>
                  <p>So wee came to a faire co≈øtly Forte, (no Princes Court like it, nor any earthly building to bee compared vnto it,) where we were let in. In which place, wee ≈øaw many bright Angels, ≈øhining like the beames of the Sun all ≈øinging melodiou≈øly with cleare voyce: <hi>Holy, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, holy, is our Lord God of Saboath.</hi> Among which I knew a great number: But the olde man forbade me to ≈øpeak vnto any. Forthwith I was brought againe to the Brook, where he ouertook me: I becam very pen≈øiue, when I thought of the worthines of the place where I had b√©en.</p>
                  <p>But the old man, willed me to re≈øt contented, for this ≈øhort time ≈øhall quickly haue an end, and within fiue daies thou ≈øhalt be brought againe into this place.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:20541:10"/>He willed me, be≈øides, to manife≈øt (vnto the Peni<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tent) the mercy of GOD, and to ≈øay vnto the world, that he is bent to wrath: cheefly to tho≈øe that de≈øpi≈øe, and giue no credite to his examples, which h√©e miraculou≈øly hath ≈øhewed vnto his people. The≈øe are but war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings ≈øent vs, to mollifie our hard hearts, and to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moni≈øh vs from the dete≈øtable Pride, which is heere maintained, becau≈øe before GOD you ≈øhall finde it damnable.</p>
                  <p>O people full of contempt, de≈øpi≈øing one an other, ≈øome for Riches, ≈øome for Beauty, others for Wi≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome, ≈øome for one thing, ≈øome for an other: where as before GOD, we are all alike with him, poore and rich: notwith≈øtanding, he will not goe forward with his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, hee will hold his hand, and moderate it with mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cie, if he finde but ≈øome ≈ømall number, penitent for their ≈øinnes.</p>
                  <p>If you amend not, and turne to GOD, hee will forthwith ≈øend on you a generall alteration, and ≈øuch an one, as not onely men, but Birds of the ayre and all li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing things, ≈øhall tremble at his wrath. Warres ≈øhall greatly greeue the earth, and they ≈øhall de≈øtroy Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treyes and people: Men ≈øhall bee mo≈øt greeuou≈øly cha≈øed from their hou≈øes, and mo≈øt mi≈øerably murthered. And before this happen, there ≈øhall come a great dearth: and then God will take his owne that haue turned vnto him, not ≈øuffering them to ≈øee this mi≈øerie: but tho≈øe that liue after, ≈øhall truely feele the wrath of God, ≈øo that tho≈øe which remaine in the third yeere ≈øhall well ≈øay, <hi>Where haue you beene, that you are not yet de≈øtroyed?</hi> Many for feare ≈øhall decay: there ≈øhall bee great Earthquakes, through which. Townes and St√©eples, Ca≈øtles, Fortes and hou≈øes ≈øhall be throwen down on heapes. Then ≈øhall follow ≈øuch mi≈øhap, as is not nece≈ø≈øary to be ≈øpoken of, for the ≈øin of the people is abhominable &amp; cur≈øed before God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="tcp:20541:10"/>After this great and terrible trouble, there ≈øhall great Peace ari≈øe, and the people ≈øhall liue in great tranquillitie: there ≈øhall be want of learned men, and good Rulers: wherefore good people, let this terrifie your pride, being euen the whole puddle of ≈øinne, and the roote of abhomination.</p>
                  <p>The cloathes which Mi≈øtre≈ø≈øe <hi>Annys</hi> did weare, for the Pride and vaine-glory of her Parents, they ≈øhall be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come loath≈øome to all per≈øons, whereby none ≈øhall be able to weare them, but ≈øhall remaine as a nece≈ø≈øarie example to all per≈øons. This ≈øpeech twi≈øe ≈øpoken, was marked of many: and others were inqui≈øitiue, to ≈øee the cloths: which being ≈øtirred, there aro≈øe a great and dete≈øtable ≈øtinke, that no man could either weare them, or abide by them. Which ≈øtrange thing, the good Gentlewoman her Mother con≈øidering: cau≈øed the ≈øaid Chamber to be walled in, ≈øo that none may come to them any way. Thus the Maide continued in the≈øe and ≈øundry ≈øuch other ≈øpeeches.</p>
                  <p>In the meane time, diuers learned Preachers came vnto her, and talked with her, as concerning Spirituall matters, which ≈øhe was glad of. To whom ≈øh√©e y√©elded harty thankes, ≈øignifying to them, that the fifth day was now come, wherein ≈øhe ≈øhould be taken from the world. But before ≈øh√©e departed, ≈øhe was de≈øirous to receiue the Sacrament, and Chri≈øtian Communion of the body and blood of Chri≈øt, which Mai≈øter <hi>Nicholas Faber</hi> did mini≈øter vnto her: And all that day hee did rea≈øon with her: to whom ≈øhe vttered ≈øuch godly rea≈øons, as it made him marueilou≈øly a≈øtonied.</p>
                  <p>Many people came to ≈ø√©e her at that day, and to ≈ø√©e what would fall out. Then meat was brought, and ≈øhe ≈øat down at the Table, ≈øhe ≈øaid Grace, thanked God, and ble≈ø≈øed her Father and Mother, and in≈øtantly de≈øired her Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb facs="tcp:20541:11"/>
that he would honour his Parents, and not to leaue therein their olde age: in ≈øo doing, he ≈øhould be rewarded with the ble≈ø≈øing of God.</p>
                  <p>Mai≈øter <hi>Faber</hi> came now againe to vi≈øite her (as his manner was) and he ≈øaid vnto her, how doe you? To whom ≈øhe friendly gaue her hand, and ≈ømiling, thanked him of his paines which he had taken with her.</p>
                  <p>Then for a la≈øt farewell, ≈øhe rehear≈øed all the war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to the people, de≈øiring them, not to bee vnmindfull of them: And anone after, betw√©ene one and two of the clocke, patiently ≈øitting in a Chayre, ≈øhe committed her Soule to God; and yeelded vp the Gho≈øt.

force, that their mighty bankes were not able to containe them.</p>
                  <p>At the fir≈øt entrance of this watery conquerour, it is ≈øaid it apeared to the inhabitants a far of, like vnto a cloud rouling out of the ≈økies, or a ≈øtorm of raine, by the winds blowne nearer and nearer, but approching to the ≈øight of men, it ≈ø√©emed to bee a ≈øecond deluge: a feare ≈øo ≈øodaine, that well was that man that by flight could pre≈øerue his life: not one place, not one field, not one village, nor one towne receiued hurt by the ouerflowing of the≈øe waters, but many: yea, many were the lo≈ø≈øes comming thereby: for it is well knowne, and by true reports iu≈øtified, that n√©ere vnto <hi>Long-Sutten</hi> afore≈øaid, ≈øome eight√©ene or twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty villages had ≈øhare of this lamentable ≈øpoile, &amp; as much ground ouerflowed as is compa≈ø≈øed in the circuite of ≈øix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>t√©ene miles, all the low parts of that country ≈øtood like the maine Ocean, or the Zurick ≈øeas betwixt Holland and Zeland, where nothing is left in ≈øight aboue waters but pinacles and Church ≈øt√©eples: ≈øo was h√©ere at that wofull time, nothing ≈ø√©ene but the vpper parts of hou≈øes, and the tops of tr√©es: the fury and ≈øtrength of the ≈øalt waters thus broke in ≈øo preuailed, that they ouerturned whole ≈øtackes and Rickes of Pea≈øe and Beanes, and carried them away like ≈øtating ≈øhips into the maine ocean.</p>
                  <p>It is al≈øo credibly reported, that aboue two thou≈øand head of cattell, be≈øides many thou≈øands of ≈øh√©epe peri≈øhed in the ≈øame floods, and no newes of them as yet to be heard of, but onely ≈øome few, ≈øcattering h√©ere and there, floting vpon the waters ten or twelue myles from the owners, the re≈øt are ≈øuppo≈øed to be born into the ≈øea, who≈øe deuou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring wombe is able to drench vp all the wealth that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maines vpon the land, for the ≈øea is much more larger and richer then all the world be≈øide: therefore let vs pray that the Lord with his mighty and ≈øtrong arme, may keepe vs from the Rigour of this mercile≈ø≈øe inuades, and ≈øo ≈øtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then

                  <p>Let vs call to minde the like mi≈øhap ≈øome ≈øixe yeares ≈øince in the We≈øt parts of England, where the waters of the Sea were violently driuen ouer their Bankes by a

South we≈øt wind, as the≈øe were oppo≈øite to them with a Northea≈øt, where likewi≈øe many a wealthy village ≈øu≈øtai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned much hurt, hardly recouered at this day: now Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhire thy ≈øorrowes may compare with theirs, the waters haue emptied thy pa≈øtures of increa≈øing cattell, as they did their fields; ≈øuch is the cruelty of this liquid element, for if it is rebell and get beyond his bounds, it is able to inuade a whole kingdome, ouer-turne Townes &amp; Tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and deuoure vp all liuing creatures therein remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: let this one thing following be a ≈øufficient pre≈øident, to make knowne the ≈øtrength of the≈øe head≈øtrong waters, ≈øtraying from their ≈øoueraigne Prince the maine ocean, for the aboundance thereof came into the lowe mar≈øh grounds of that countrey, with ≈øuch ≈øodaine violence, that a ≈øtrong built hou≈øe, wholly as it ≈øtoode, without ≈øplitting or ≈øeparation, was borne like a ≈øhip vpon the waters, two miles from the place where it fa≈øt was builded, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple remaining therein hauing no hurt, but ≈øafely ≈øet vpon a hill ≈øide, and ≈øo pre≈øerued from the further danger: An other ≈øtrange accident happened in the ≈øame County.

                  <p>Not onely Lincolne≈øhire can complaine of the ≈øeas op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion. but diuers countries bordering vpon her ≈øhores, which the ea≈øterne part of E≈ø≈øex can well witnes: what goodly grounds and fayre pa≈øtures haue b√©en there ouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowed: what heards of kine and ≈øheepe haue been there drowned: what long time ≈øpent for the recouery, to the great charge and halfe vndooing of the owners, nay fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a hinderance to the whole Countrey.</p>
                  <p>With griefe of heart I now call to minde, the great lo≈ø≈øe and hinderance of an honourable Lord of this land, hapning this pre≈øent month of Nouember, in the ≈øaid County of E≈ø≈øex, where many a hundred akers of gallant ground, clo≈øing vpon the ≈øea coa≈øt, is quite ouerflowed, ≈øtanding now like a white Sea, hardly euer to be recoue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, a lo≈ø≈øe of many thou≈øand pounds, which might haue rel√©eued the e≈øtates of many thou≈øands of poore people: God is angry with vs, in changing this land habitation, into a watery ocean, which by little and little, ≈øeekes to ≈øteale the whole earth into hir in≈øearchable and d√©epe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Goodwin</hi> ≈øands vpon the borders of Kent is likewi≈øe one of the Seas cruelties, which ≈øucking ≈øandy gulfe hath deuoured ≈øo many goodly Ships, many other breaches giues the Sea pa≈ø≈øage into the Land threatning our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruction.
